# Football-Statistics-Management-System

is an application that is designed and developed for football players, teams, analysts and fans. The system helps users to refer to the statistical data. Large statistical databases allow scouts to search for players more quickly and efficiently. This saves clubs an incredible amount of time and money, as the scout can filter their search down to a select number of players, meaning they can more easily assess which players are worth going to watch. Depending on the available data, different analysis tasks can be executed. The software is developed using MySQL, HTML and database. In the software we can register as a user. More and more football teams are beginning to use such statistical analysis in order to gain a competitive advantage over their opponents.

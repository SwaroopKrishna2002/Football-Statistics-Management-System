			<p>Statistics are used for a variety of different reasons within professional football clubs today. Here are a few of the main ones!</p>
			<p><h2 style="margin-left: 20px;">Scouting</h2></p>
			<p>Large statistical databases allow scouts to search for players more quickly and efficiently. This saves clubs an incredible amount of time and money, as the scout can filter their search down to a select number of players, meaning they can more easily asses which players are worth going to watch.</p>
			<p><h2 style="margin-left: 20px">Training</h2></p>
			<p>More and more football teams are using statistical analysis in order to gain a competitive advantage over their opponents. Wearable technology that monitors things like the distance covered by players and the positions they occupy on the pitch help coaches build specific training sessions around players to ensure that they’re performing at the highest possible level. As a result of these tailored training strategies, players are also far less likely to get injured throughout the season.</p>
			<p><h2 style="margin-left: 20px;">Punditry and Commentary</h2></p>
			<p>It’s not just the teams who benefit from statistics, commentary teams and pundits use statistics to increase the entertainment value for their viewers. Pundits use statistics to provide play-by-play explanations, discuss predictions, and provide context to their comments made during a game.
			<br>
			<br>
			<p><h2 style="margin-left: 20px;">Solution.....</h2></p>
 			<p>The proposed solution to the above problem is a Football Statistics management system that provides a unified interface for the user to access all information and statistics regarding various different disciplines. The System will be able to meet the following objectives:  <br>
•	Data collection for both teams plus the ball provides a holistic view of the game, helping develop more tactical match strategies.  <br>
•	This System introduces a catalogue of different models and metrics, illustrating how they can be best applied within professional football.<br>  
•	This system introduces the tools that are used within football analytics, focusing on their applications and key uses.  <br>
•	This system showcases how different analysis can lead to different conclusions, and the wider impact this can have across an entire football club.<br> 
•	Create new player measures and ratings with expertly curated editorial content, integrated with live and historical data.  <br>
•	Highly detailed match and player insights, pre-game player notes, and more can be used to help your own team better preview upcoming matchups.  </p>
